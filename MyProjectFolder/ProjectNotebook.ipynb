    "## Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "The object of this project is to simulate some functions of a in-memory file system to manage the directories and files. The functions include: \n",
    "- ls: Given a path in string format. If it is a file path, return a list that only contains this file's name. If it is a directory path, return the list of file and directory names in this directory. The output (file and directory names together) should in lexicographic order.\n",
    "- mkdir: Given a directory path that does not exist, you should make a new directory according to the path. If the middle directories in the path don't exist either, you should create them as well. This function has void return type.\n",
    "- addContentToFile: Given a file path and file content in string format. If the file doesn't exist, user need to create that file containing given content. If the file already exists, user need to append given content to original content. This function has void return type.\n",
    "- readContentFromFile: Given a file path, return its content in string format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "High level analysis:\n",
    "Actually the file management system is a tree structure, more specifically, we can use tree nodes to represent both file and directory. To implement this system, I plan to create two classes: \"File\" and \"FileSystem\". For class \"File\", there should be three fields: files(dict), children (dict: key: string of contenet, value File), isFile(boolean). If isFile is true: content represent the content of file, children has no effect; otherwise, children represent the subfiles or subdirectory. To implement these functions, the high level idea are: \n",
    "- ls -> search path\n",
    "- mkdir -> insert tree node\n",
    "- addContentToFile -> insert words\n",
    "- readContentFrom File -> search words"
